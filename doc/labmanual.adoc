== Lab 1
// tag::procedure[]
=== Step 1: Log Into the Desktop
* Using a web browser, connect to the roundtower Training Portal, using the credentials provided by your trainer:
[source]
http://goo.gl/SRGcuX

* You will see the lab environment listed as:
[source]
CICD-Training-v11

* Under the "Actions" heading, select *_View_*.
* In this view you will see the systems in your lab environment.  Find the VM named *_Developer Desktop_* and open the virtual console by clicking the *_Console_* button.

TIP:  Pop-up Blockers are known to interfere with the virtual console.  If you aren't able to open the virtual console, disable any pop-up blockers and try again.

* Log into the Developer Desktop using the credentials specified above.

=== Step 2: Log Into GitLab
* On the developer desktop, open Firefox.  (A link is provided in the dock on the left of the screen.)
* Connect to GitLab, using the credentials listed above:
[source]
http://gitlab.localdomain/

* You are now connected to GitLab.  This system is your source code management and collaboration tool.
* On your dashboard, select the project *_Administrator/Lab1_*.
* In the left sidebar, select *_Issues_*.
* Click on the issue *_Story: New Content for Site_*.

=== Step 3: Review the User Story
* In this lab, you will assume the role of a developer.  The user story *_Story: New Content for Site_* has been assigned to you.  Take a moment to review the the content of the user story.
* Before you alter the site content, you must set up your Continuous Integration toolchain.

=== Step 4: Set Up Continuous Integration Toolchain
* On the Developer Desktop, open a new tab in Firefox
* Connect to Jenkins, using the credentials listed above:
[source]
http://jenkins.localdomain:8080

* Click the *_New Item_* link in the left side menu.
* Name the new pipeline *_Lab1_*.
* Select the *_Pipeline_* option to define the job type.
* Select *_OK_*.
* On the next page, select the option *_GitHub project_*, and enter the following in the *_Project url_* field:

[source]
http://gitlab.localdomain/root/Lab1

* Ensure that *_Student GitLab_* is selected for *_GitLab connection_*.  If it isn't, please select it from the dropdown list.
* Select the option *_Build when a change is pushed to GitLab_*.  Accept the default selections.
* Under the *_Pipeline_* heading, select *_Pipeline script from SCM_*.  For *_SCM_*, select *_Git_*.  For *_Repository URL_*, enter the following:

[source]
http://gitlab.localdomain/root/Lab1.git

* Select *_Save_*.  Your continuous integration pipeline is now configured.
* Verify that everything is working properly by selecting *_Build Now_*.

=== Step 5: Get the Source Code for the Feature
* Now that you Continuous Integration toolchain is working properly, you can begin the development process.
* First, you must clone your project's source code repository.
* On the Developer Desktop, open the Terminal.  (A link is provided in the dock on the left of the screen.)
* To clone the source code repository, type the following command:

[source]
git clone http://gitlab.localdomain/root/Lab1.git

* Change your working directory to your source code repository

[source]
cd Lab1

=== Step 6:  Develop the Tests
* Before you alter the source code, you must first develop unit tests.  For this lab, you will alter existing tests to verify that your new content is present.
* First, change your working directory to the "tests" directory

[source]
cd tests

* In this directory are two tests: *_index-test_* and *_layout-test_*. First, you will modify *_index-test_*:

[source]
nano index-test.txt

* In this file, you define the content that must be present in the site.  Replace these two lines with the requested content from Scenario 1 & 2 of the User Story.
* _Remember, the text you specify here will be looked for *exactly* the new site, so aware of spaces and capitalization._

TIP:  You can save a file by pressing "ctrl+O".  You can close a file by pressing "ctrl+X".

* Now, alter the second test with the requested content from Scenario 3 & 4 of the User Story.

[source]
nano layout-test.txt

* Now that the tests are complete, you can alter the site content.

=== Step 7:  Alter the Site Content
* Now you can alter the site content.  To begin, change your working directory:

[source]
cd ..
cd src/site/views

* Now you alter the index with the requested content from Scenario 1 & 2 from the user story.

[source]
nano index.jade

* Once that is complete, alter the layout with the requested content from Scenario 3 & 4.

[source]
nano layout.jade

=== Step 8:  Commit Changes and Push to Central Repository
Now that your site has been modified to according to the user story, you can commit your changes and push them to GitLab.
* First, change the working directory.

[source]
cd ~/Lab1

* Next, add all altered files to the change set.

[source]
git add .

* Next, commit the changes.

[source]
git commit -m "Issue #1 - Tests Altered, Feature Complete"

* Last, push the change to GitLab.

[source]
git push

* This push will trigger the continuous integration system (Jenkins) to build and test the change.  You can observe it's progress by switching back to Firefox.
* By hovering over each phase of the pipeline, you can view the logs for that phase.
* If any phase of your pipeline fails, utilize the logs to identify the error.  Please ask your trainer for assistance if required.
